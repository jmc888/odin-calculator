Odin JavaScript Project - Calculator

## Requirements
- Support add, subtract, multiply and divide operations for integer and float input.
- Display result in integer when there is no decimal point; otherwise, round the result to the maximum digits that fit in the display box.
- Display the latest add/subtract result when user clicks on operation even before a `=` button is clicked.
- Handle order of operations elegantly, that multiply and divide have higher precedence than add and subtract.
